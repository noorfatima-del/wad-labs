        <h2>MPhil (Computer Science)</h2>
        
        <p>
          The objective of the <strong>MPhil Computer Science</strong> programme is to train students to initiate research work. 
          The duration of the MPhil programme is two years (4 semesters).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          MPhil is a 50 credit hour programme comprising 24 credit hours of course work and 26 credit hours of research work. 
          Each course carries 3 credit hours. Students are required to complete 2 compulsory courses and choose 6 optional 
          courses to fulfill the 24 credit hour coursework requirement. The courses are structured to expose students to research 
          activities early in the programme, laying the foundation for their research work.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Research Component</h3>
        <p>
          Students will register for a research topic in the 3rd semester and are expected to complete their research work by 
          the end of the 4th semester. The research will culminate in the submission of a thesis.
