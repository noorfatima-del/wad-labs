                    <h3>Human Information Interaction</h3>
                    <p>Investigates all aspects of information usage by humans including behavior, interaction techniques, and retrieval frameworks. Providing research on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in improving the way people interact with technology.HCI research explores how users engage with computer systems, aiming to design more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces. By studying user behavior, cognitive psychology, ergonomics, and design principles, HCI researchers identify challenges in existing systems and propose innovative solutions. This research not only enhances user experience but also drives the development of accessible technologies that cater to diverse populations. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, ongoing research in HCI remains essential to ensure that digital tools are both effective and inclusive.</p>
